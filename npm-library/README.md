# trydivJS

**trydivJS** is a modern, lightweight, and efficient UI library designed to streamline web development. It offers a rich collection of pre-built UI components, templates, and boilerplates, enabling developers to build high-quality user interfaces with minimal effort. With the latest update, trydivJS now generates a `utils/` folder for component management and provides a simple CLI command to add components directly.

## Installation

Install trydivJS as a development dependency via npm:

```sh
npm install trydivjs --save-dev
```

---

## Getting Started

After installing `trydivJS`, the library automatically generates a `utils/` folder in your project root. You donâ€™t need to run any script manuallyâ€”the CLI takes care of component generation.

To add any UI component, simply run:

```sh
npx trydivjs add <component_name>
```

Replace `<component_name>` with the name of the desired component.

### Example

To add the `Card01` component, run:

```sh
npx trydivjs add Card01
```
