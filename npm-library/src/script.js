- Your PC will restart just as you finally fix a bug you've been debugging for 6 hours.\n
- Windows Update: the only thing in life that's unavoidable besides death and taxes.\n
- Clicking "Remind me later" on updates? Congratulations, you now have a second job.\n
- Task Manager crashes while trying to close an unresponsive programâ€”oh, the irony.\n
- "Not Responding" is not a status; itâ€™s a Windows lifestyle.\n
- Your Wi-Fi adapter goes missing like a deadbeat dadâ€”there one moment, gone the next.\n
- Enjoy the suspense of a "Preparing Windows" screen that prepares you for nothing but regret.\n\n

Linux users, let's be real:\n
- Rebooting is for the weak.\n
- Your OS is stableâ€”until you touch anything related to Nvidia drivers.\n
- "Arch is the best!" â€” said every Arch user, right before spending 3 hours fixing a dependency issue.\n
- You didn't install Linux, you signed up for a life of manually fixing everything.\n
- Half your time is spent evangelizing Linux to people who will never use it.\n\n

Developers in general:\n
- "It works on my machine" is the battle cry of broken deployments everywhere.\n
- Stack Overflow isnâ€™t a toolâ€”itâ€™s your entire personality.\n
- "Just one more fix" is how you end up debugging at 4 AM with existential dread.\n
- The only thing that crashes more than your code is your will to live.\n
- If comments are documentation, then your codebase is an ancient scroll written in a lost language.\n
- Git commit messages range from "fixed stuff" to "I have no idea whatâ€™s happening anymore."\n
- Debugging is just staring at the screen until the error message magically makes sense.\n
- "AI will replace developers" â€” sure, right after it figures out how to center a div.\n\n
