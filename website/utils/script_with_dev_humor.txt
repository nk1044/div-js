Windows users, brace yourselves:

- Your PC will restart just as you finally fix a bug you've been debugging for 6 hours.

- Windows Update: the only thing in life that's unavoidable besides death and taxes.

- Clicking "Remind me later" on updates? Congratulations, you now have a second job.

- Task Manager crashes while trying to close an unresponsive programâ€”oh, the irony.

- "Not Responding" is not a status; itâ€™s a Windows lifestyle.

- Your Wi-Fi adapter goes missing like a deadbeat dadâ€”there one moment, gone the next.

- Enjoy the suspense of a "Preparing Windows" screen that prepares you for nothing but regret.



Linux users, let's be real:

- Rebooting is for the weak.

- Your OS is stableâ€”until you touch anything related to Nvidia drivers.

- "Arch is the best!" â€” said every Arch user, right before spending 3 hours fixing a dependency issue.

- You didn't install Linux, you signed up for a life of manually fixing everything.

- Half your time is spent evangelizing Linux to people who will never use it.



Developers in general:

- "It works on my machine" is the battle cry of broken deployments everywhere.

- Stack Overflow isnâ€™t a toolâ€”itâ€™s your entire personality.

- "Just one more fix" is how you end up debugging at 4 AM with existential dread.

- The only thing that crashes more than your code is your will to live.

- If comments are documentation, then your codebase is an ancient scroll written in a lost language.

- Git commit messages range from "fixed stuff" to "I have no idea whatâ€™s happening anymore."

- Debugging is just staring at the screen until the error message magically makes sense.

- "AI will replace developers" â€” sure, right after it figures out how to center a div.
